// Jimmy's catalogue tool.
//
// Shop questions must never go near the knowledge base. The knowledge base is
// preparedness doctrine written by SC 03; the catalogue is a table of what we
// actually stock. Routing a stock question through doctrine is how Jimmy ended
// up declining to say whether we sell tents.
//
// It is a tool in effect rather than in protocol: the provider layer has no
// function-calling yet. The lookup is deterministic, cheap and testable, and
// swapping it for a real tool call later touches only this file.
//
// v2 — after live testing. Jimmy listed eight tents, was asked which suited
// "me, my son, my wife and a dog", and said we had "no specific family tent
// options" before sending the customer to "our store" and "local options". He
// is the store. Three separate faults sat behind that one sentence and all
// three are answered here:
//
//   * he searched again instead of reasoning over what he had just retrieved
//     — so results now travel forward and arrive back as carried context;
//   * he searched on SPELLING, and nothing is named "family tent" — so a
//     household is read out of the question and turned into a capacity filter;
//   * an empty result told him to say we have nothing — so an empty result now
//     escalates to the nearest thing we DO have, plus the size of the shortfall.
//
// DEMO SCOPE. Reads the fuller product set rather than the `approved_products`
// view — only ~83 rows are approved and the 58 super-heroes are still drafts —
// with `rejected` excluded. Every row carries its own status and research stage
// so Jimmy can tell stock from research and say which.

    `- Prices and status are real. Quote them. Never invent a product, a price or a stock position.\n` +
    `- Everything listed here is shown to the customer as a CARD under your reply — picture, price, ` +
    `Add button. So write about them, do not itemise them as a numbered menu, and never ask the ` +
    `customer to reply with a number.\n` +
    `- A row that is not "approved" is something we are still working through — say so rather than ` +
    `presenting it as ready to buy.\n` +
    `- YOU ARE STEALTHCRAFTER. Never tell a customer to "check with our store", "contact the shop", ` +
    `"try a local retailer" or "look elsewhere". There is no one else to ask. You are who they are asking.\n` +
    `- WHEN WE CANNOT MEET THE REQUEST, never dead-end. Answer in this shape:\n` +
    `    (a) say plainly what we do not have;\n` +
    `    (b) recommend the nearest thing we DO have, and be honest about how it falls short;\n` +
    `    (c) tell them what to look for so the advice is worth having anyway;\n` +
    `    (d) tell them you are flagging the gap to the buying team — we log it, and it is true.\n` +
    `  Being useful about a real range beats being vague about an imaginary one.\n`;
